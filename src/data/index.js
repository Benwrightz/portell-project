      "Winemaking: We find the secret of this pale rosé wine in its Provence style wine making. Using only the juice from grapes harvested in the early morning so that we receive them into the cellar as cold as possible and avoid the must from oxidations. Once we've obtained these musts, they are soaked with the buds down for more than 10 days at low temperature before fermentation to increase its finesse and aromatic intensity and preserve the delicate color that makes this varietal of Trepat so special.\r\nTasting note: It has a pale, clear, and shinning rose rosé color, with salmon color undertones. It's delicate and fruity with notes of white peach and apricot mixed with passion fruit and hints of white fruits (pear, apple). It is full and fresh, well balanced, it has good acidity, and with a persistent finish of citric and white fruits.\r\nGastronomy: Ideal as an aperitif, yet agile enough to accompany any kind of shellfish, light „tapas\", and soft cheeses.\r\nServing Temperature: 8-10°C",
