Using only the juice from grapes harvested in the early morning so that we receive them into the cellar as cold as possible and avoid the must from oxidations.

It's delicate and fruity with notes of white peach and apricot mixed with passion fruit and hints of white fruits (pear, apple). It is full and fresh, well balanced, it has good acidity, and with a persistent finish of citric and white fruits.\r\nGastronomy: Ideal as an aperitif, yet agile enough to accompany any kind of shellfish, light ‚Äûtapas\", and soft cheeses.\r\nServing Temperature: 8-10¬∞C",
